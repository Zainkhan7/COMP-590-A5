This program demonstrates a retractable light saber with a stamina system such that when the user presses the left mouse button the light saber swings and uses some stamina. Once out of stamina light saber cannot be swung anymore and stamina takes sometime to recharge as per the bar. 
Spacebar is to retract lightsaber as per assignment instructions. There are different sound effects for swinging and for retracting and they were taken from the following resources:
